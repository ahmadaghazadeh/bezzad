### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Experienced application developer and software engineer in leveraging agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. My day job keeps me in C# most of the time, but I do get to play with Angular and other technologies a bit. More than work and income, the friendly working environment is priority for me. I hope that as much as I'm useful to an organization, the organization will be also useful and exciting for me.
